As a student
So that I can remember people's names
I want an IRB application that stores the names of people I meet

Imagine how to use it:

add_name

add_meeting_place

show_names

# The imagined example
add_name(name)

# The expectation
expect(add_name("Jeff Hurst")).to eq "Jeff Hurst saved"

# The full test

describe "#add_name" do
	it "Shows the name that was saved" do
		expect(add_name("Jeff Hurst")).to eq "Jeff Hurst saved"
	end
end
